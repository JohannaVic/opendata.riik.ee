  <h1>Making Sense of the Corona Crisis with Open Data</h1>
  <p><strong> Many countries have begun relaxing their emergency measures, but the new coronavirus is still with us. In addition to teaching us to properly wash our hands, the epidemic has taught the world another lesson: decisions about human lives need data to move without restrictions. What do open data tell us about the virus?</strong></p>
  <h2> How many have caught the virus?</h2>
  <p> There’s probably hardly anyone who hasn’t seen the Johns Hopkins University’s <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">coronavirus dashboard</a>. As one of the first ones out there, it inspired the development of tens of similar applications in a number of countries. Such dashboards usually visualize statistical data on the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, discharges and deaths. Some, however, offer more information. For example, <a href="https://www.againstcovid19.com/singapore/dashboard">Singapore’s dashboard</a> also gives an overview of the source of infection (imported or local) and significant local clusters. <a href="https://pinginsights.nz/covid-19-cases-in-new-zealand/">New Zealand’s dashboard</a> does the same, and additionally visualizes the spread of the virus among different ethnic groups and the impact of the epidemic on the national economy. At the same time, Slovenia’s <a href="https://covid19.alpaka.si/">Alpaka.si app</a> stands out for the use of various types of diagrams and indicators. As an interesting feature, it compares Slovenia’s coronavirus stats with neighboring countries, and forecasts the number of new cases for the next three days based on existing data. Such open data-based applications not only satisfy public appetite for information but also serve as convenient tools for policymakers in charge of designing crisis measures.</p>

  <h2>How did the virus travel across the world?</h2>
  <p> How did the new coronavirus travel from a market stall in a Chinese city all the way to Tokyo, Tallinn and Teheran? The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/22/world/coronavirus-spread.html">New York Times article with rich visualizations</a> vividly demonstrates what a dangerous mix of circumstances was created by China’s delayed reaction to the spread of the new virus and the massive movement of people around the Chinese New Year. By the time the government installed mobility restrictions, 7 million people had already travelled from Wuhan to other cities during the first three weeks of January. From the Wuhan Airport, people took off to Bangkok, Seoul, New York, Sydney... We know what happened next. The New York Times combines data from the Chinese technology company Baidu, mobile data from Chinese telecoms, Johns Hopkins University’s data about the spread of the virus, data from WHO and the US public sector, research papers and other sources. This article is an excellent example of how the media can use interactive infographics to translate raw data into stories that anyone can understand. This way, the mechanics of a global virus outbreak can be easily explained to those who lack the skills to delve into complicated datasets on their own.</p>

  <h2>How to beat the virus?</h2>
  <p> The coronavirus epidemic has given an <a href="http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/why-open-science-is-critical-to-combatting-covid-19-cd6ab2f9/">unprecedented impetus</a> to open science. Thanks to <a href="https://www.gisaid.org/">open gene expression data</a> we already have a pretty good understanding of <a href="https://nextstrain.org/">how the virus mutates</a>. Researchers also constantly share data about vaccine research and epidemiological models. In order to foster knowledge sharing, tens of powerful publishers have made <a href="http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/why-open-science-is-critical-to-combatting-covid-19-cd6ab2f9/"> research articles available free of charge</a>, forgoing substantial revenues that they could make selling academic publications. At the same time, the research database Dimensions is collecting <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-kTZJZ1GAhJ2m4GAIhw1ZdlgO46JpvX0ZQa232VWRmw/edit#gid=2119699907">new data</a> on a daily basis on all kinds of Covid-19 related publications, clinical trials, datasets and research funding opportunities. The database started in March with slightly over 2000 research articles and 20 datasets. By the end of May, the number of articles has grown to 37 000 and the number of datasets to 400. At a time when every hour of scientists’ work is worth its weight in gold, sharing open data helps save enormous amounts of researchers’ working time. It is precisely thanks to this that the whole world’s dream – creating a vaccine in a couple of years instead of the usual 10-15 – could actually become true.</p>

  <h2>How did people get infected?</h2>
  <p> At the beginning of the pandemic, Singapore was one of the shining stars whose response to the epidemic was considered a success story – though prematurely, as it later appeared. One of the measures that helped Singapore effectively contain the virus in the first weeks was the government’s meticulous work detecting the sources of infection and identifying people who had been in contact with those diagnosed with Covid-19. The Singaporean company Kontinentalist did not leave the Ministry of Health’s data on the shelf and created a <a href="https://kontinentalist.com/stories/singapore-coronavirus-cases-spread-connections">visual overview</a> of the connections between the people diagnosed with Covid-19. The data can be sorted by cluster, gender, residency, status or transmission type. The screenshot below visualizes the largest infection clusters. The yellow cluster represents the group of people who got infected in Singapore’s Mustafa shopping center, while the orange cluster represents those infected in a workers’ dormitory.</p>

  <p><em>Source: screenshot from <a href="https://kontinentalist.com/stories/singapore-coronavirus-cases-spread-connections">https://kontinentalist.com/stories/singapore-coronavirus-cases-spread-connections</a></em></p>
  <p> In the graph, individual people are represented by anonymous numbers, while still maintaining some of their properties, such as gender, age and source of infection. In the above graph, we can see the details of a 28-year-old man of Indian origin who caught the virus at the workers’ dormitory. In fact, thanks to collecting and sharing these sorts of data, we now know that dorms have also become infection hotspots in other countries, for example <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2020/05/12/covid-19-outbreaks-in-german-slaughterhouses-expose-grim-working-conditions-in-meat-indust">in Germany</a>.</p>
  <h2> Where can I get a face mask?</h2>
  <p> Another Asian country caught the world’s attention during the pandemic. Taiwan, a country of 24 million people, has so far managed to keep the number of infections surprisingly low. They also boast a number of great open data-driven collaborations between the government, private sector and civil society. As one example, open data helped quickly resolve the problem of people panic buying and hoarding face masks, which created long queues behind pharmacy doors. As the first step, the government rolled out an <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3870428">ID-based mask rationing system</a> to prevent face masks from running out of stock. The system limited the quantity of masks each person can buy to two per week. Second, <a href="https://data.nhi.gov.tw/Datasets/DatasetResource.aspx?rId=A21030000I-D50001-001">data about drugstore locations and mask stocks</a> were quickly published as open data. This enabled the government to engage volunteers and by now, volunteers have developed tens of map applications with <a href="https://mask.pdis.nat.gov.tw/">real-time visualizations of mask stocks</a> in pharmacies around the country. A simple case of how publishing open data and making information freely available can save people’s time, reduce pharmacists’ workload, and prevent public panic.</p>

  <h2> How did lockdown affect the environment?</h2>
  <p> The lockdown measures that many countries installed as an emergency measure this spring not only helped “flatten the curve” but also drastically reduced the volume of air and road transportation. Based on Eurocontrol’s <a href="https://www.eurocontrol.int/Economics/DailyTrafficVariation-States.html">flight traffic data</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XIcJrtc36iA?autoplay=1">80 percent fewer airplanes</a> flew across the Estonian airspace this April compared to same time last year. The European Data Portal combined data about air traffic in Europe, road transportation in the Netherlands, and air quality in Europe and found that travel restrictions have <a href="https://www.europeandataportal.eu/en/covid-19/stories/covid-19-related-traffic-reduction-and-decreased-air-pollution-europe">reduced the amount of nitrogen dioxide in the air</a>. However, the impact of reduced traffic on air quality is not exactly linear. Thanks to open data from the Copernicus observation program, scientists now have a more nuanced understanding of what factors and pollutants affect air quality. We know, for example, that reduced levels of nitrogen dioxide may in fact contribute to an increase in the ozone concentration due to certain chemical processes, weather and sunlight conditions. This may <a href="https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/european-air-quality-information-support-covid-19-crisis">adversely affect the overall air quality index</a>. Therefore, combining new data with existing data from long-term monitoring programs helps us interpret what we see and thereby increase the utility of open data.</p>

  <h2>Will hairdressers lose their jobs?</h2>
  <p> Guess how many people started doing their own haircuts in home isolation? How many are worried about accumulating belly fat? How much did the popularity of Minecraft increase during lockdown? How did social distancing affect people’s interest in eyelash extensions? The US company Glimps has put all that information on charts that are pretty much self-explanatory. The <a href="https://meetglimpse.com/covid19/">Covid-19 consumer impact tracker</a> looks at the coronavirus crisis crisis from an unexpected and witty angle, showing us how the crisis has affected consumption patterns (something we might not give much thought about on a daily basis). The tracker does not use open data but big data from web searches, social media, e-commerce platforms and other sources, analyzing the dynamics of specific search terms and hashtags over time. Apart from satisfying our curiosity, these data can also be used for more serious analysis, for example for studying correlations between online searches and actual consumption patterns or predicting consumption trends to plan and optimize inventories.</p>

  <p>	All these examples from coronavirus trackers to consumption curves are obviously just a drop in the sea of data-driven applications, dashboards and articles that have been created in the past months to make better sense of the situation. Those who want to dive deeper into this world should definitely check out the <a href="https://coronavirustechhandbook.com/infographics">Coronavirus Tech Handbook</a> and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdSnXzCZ1Z7ovOrPue3O0osRUpiqTKlu8pwG9U4DwWw/edit">OECD and GOVLAB open repository</a>, which maintain regularly updated lists of various data-driven applications that have emerged in response to the Covid-19 epidemic. The <a href="https://www.europeandataportal.eu/en/covid-19/overview">European Data Portal’s</a> overview of the crisis-related open data initiatives is also worth exploring. </p>
