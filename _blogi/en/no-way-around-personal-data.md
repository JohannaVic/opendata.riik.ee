How can we be sure not to harm someone’s privacy when we release open data? In a workshop held in December, lawyers Liisi Jürgen and Siiri Vello gave some tips for navigating in the world of open and personal data.</b></p>
<p>The workshop started with a reminder that in terms of openness, data can be divided into three broad categories: 1) personal data (including special categories of personal data, formerly also called sensitive data), 2) public information, and 3) open data. It may be interesting to note that data as such do not legally have an ’owner’ – data don’t belong to anyone directly. However, if we use data by turning data into a (creative) work or if data are organized or systematized in some way, we can already start talking about rights to data, rights to datasets, rights to databases, etc. One of the key principles in this context is that the data subject (i.e. the person who the data is about) should have rights over the use of their personal data. These rights can only be restricted on a legal basis.</p>
<h3>What is personal data?</h3>
<p>Personal data are <b>all data that enable us to directly or indirectly identify a natural person</b>. It is impossible to provide an exhaustive list of all data categories that qualify as personal data (it all depends on the context), but typical examples of personal data are name, contact details and physical characteristics of a person. To illustrate, a photo of an individual person is always considered personal data; however, if the photo is detailed to the level that it reveals biometric features (e.g. detailed facial features or iris pattern), the photo could even be treated as a special category of personal data that needs to be handled extra carefully.</p>
<p>As said, context matters: if the birth date of Citizen X is published in a national newspaper without their name or any other information, the birth date is not considered personal data – the newspaper reader will not be able to identify the specific person among all people in the world merely based on their birth date. However, if the same birth date is revealed in a small group where X’s birthday is well known, the birth date qualifies as personal data because in this particular context, the birth date can be easily and directly associated with the specific person.</p>
<p>By the way, only natural persons have personal data – data relating to legal persons are not considered personal data on any occasion. That is why the data processing requirements that apply to data about natural persons do not apply when processing the name and e-mail address of a representative of a legal person.</p>
<h3>What can one do with personal data?</h3>
<p>What is both great and annoying about personal data is that you always need a lawful basis for processing (i.e. collecting, systematizing, analyzing, using, etc.) personal data. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives public sector organizations four main grounds on which personal data can be processed when fulfilling their public tasks:
<ol>
<li><b>Law</b>. Most often, a public sector organization’s right to process citizens’ personal data is derived from legislation that mandates the organization to process personal data if it is necessary for performing their official public tasks.</li>
<li><b>Contract</b>. A typical example: if an employee has accepted a certain advantage from their employer by signing an employment contract, and if the employer can only fulfil the contract by processing the employee’s personal data, the employment contract is considered as an agreement whereby the employee allows the employer to process their personal data.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with a legal obligation</b>, e.g. fulfilling accounting requirements.</li>
<li><b>Voluntary informed consent</b>. An individual can always give consent to another party for processing their personal data. Two aspects are important here. First, the consent needs to be <b>voluntary</b>, i.e. the data subject should be able to withdraw their consent at any time without sanctions. Being <b>informed</b> means that the organization processing the data needs to give the data subject a clear overview of who, how and for what purpose will use their data. By the way, asking for consent is only allowed if the data subject actually has the right to give and withdraw their consent – for example, one cannot ask for the data subject’s consent if the right to process the data is already stipulated in the law and the person has no real power to prohibit the use of their data.</li></ol></p>
<p>There are, of course, several other bases for processing personal data (e.g. legitimate interests or specific conditions for collecting data for the purposes of national statistics and scientific research), but that’s another story for another time.</p>
<p>The consent or agreement does not necessarily need to be written but the data controller needs to be able to prove that the consent has indeed been given. Therefore, lawyers still recommend data controllers to record the data subject’s consent in a written form (e.g. in a consent form, e-mail or system log, as long as the person who gave the consent can be identified). Even better if the consent form is signed by the data subject – in this case it is very difficult to dispute its validity later.</p>
<p>Once a lawful basis exists, the data controller should follow certain principles when processing personal data (these are also listed in the GDPR). Most importantly:
<ol>
<li>Collect as little personal data as possible.</li>
<li>Keep the data in a personalized form for as short a period as possible – this means pseudonymizing or erasing the data as soon as personal data are not needed any more.</li>
<li>The purpose of processing personal data should be clear and transparent.</li>
<li>The data processing activities need to be transparent and documented – the data subject should be able to monitor how their personal data has been processed.</li></ol></p>
<p>The guiding principle of the GDPR is to give the data subject power over their data. This means that the data controller needs to do <b>everything they can</b> to ensure the lawfulness and transparency of data processing.</p>
<h3>What does it all mean for open data?</h3>
<p>Public organizations seem to be facing a dilemma. On the one hand, the GDPR requires personal data to be protected; on the other, laws such the Estonian Public Information Act (PIA) require organizations to make public information open by default. Several important principles come together: right to privacy vs. government transparency and public accountability, data security vs. opportunities for creating new economic and public value from public sector-held data. Liisi Jürgen and Siiri Vello confirm that data publishers should comply both with the GDPR and PIA but one does not preclude the other – <b>open data can well be published while leaving people’s privacy intact</b>. For example:
<ul>
<li>If a dataset includes personal data which cannot be disclosed, the data could be anonymized or aggregated to a level that does not enable specific individuals to be identified from the data.</li>
<li>Another possibility is to only publish the part of the data that does not include personal data. For example, if a public organization’s official letter in response to a citizen’s request includes the citizen’s personal data in addition to the organization’s legal opinion, the document can still be made public by erasing or covering the parts containing personal data. <b>The fact that a dataset or a document includes personal data is not a sufficient reason for restricting access to the whole dataset or document</b>.</li></ul></p>
<h3>How can risks be avoided?</h3>
<p>In order to determine the best way for publishing data, organizations need to conduct an <b>impact assessment</b>. Data holders should assess the possible costs and benefits, positive and negative impacts of opening their data, and the possibilities for ensuring the protection of privacy, copyright, national security, business secret and compliance with other restrictions when publishing open data. <b>Data holders should always ask if it is possible to remove personal data from the dataset, so that the rest could still be published</b>.</p>
<p>Organizations should also assess the risks related to technological development: what would be the possible harm to data subjects if, in the future, some new technology would enable de-anonymizing the data and linking it back to specific persons? If the interference with data subjects’ privacy would not be significant, it may be justified to take the risk; if the breach would have significant negative consequences, the publication options should be weighed more carefully. In any case, if the data holder can demonstrate having conducted a risk assessment before publishing open data, it is difficult to sanction them later if someone still manages to break through the security measures.</p>
<p>Publishing data inevitably means losing part of control over the data. Once the data are out there, it is impossible to put the Gini back in the bottle, but lawyers emphasize that security risks are always there – even if the data are not made public. This is precisely why organizations need to take a holistic approach to data management, follow technological developments, publish what can be published, and regularly review the publication options and risks. Even if the impact assessment shows that publishing a dataset as open data would entail disproportionate risks, it does not automatically mean the data should not be published at all. For example, it may be possible to make part of the data available in a system that requires a prior identification of data users.</p>
<h3>What about restricting access with a paywall?</h3>
<p>The workshop involved a long discussion on the question whether public sector organizations can restrict access to public information by setting up a fee on data requests. The lawyers’ position was clear: charging a fee for data is only justified for covering the direct costs of publishing the data, but <b>a paywall is not a security measure</b>. On the contrary, charging for access may discriminate against users with fewer resources or vulnerable groups, who may benefit from the data but cannot afford paying the fees. A paywall on public data may seriously hamper equal competition between large corporations and small enterprises and prevent civil society advocacy organizations from accessing data that could support their work – however, it will likely not fend off groups with malicious intents, who more often than not are well-funded. According to the lawyers, data misuse risks could be better mitigated by other measures, such as restricting the number of data requests.</p>
<h3>Four conclusions</h3>
<p>In sum, the workshop raised at least four important points:
<ol>
<li>Personal data protection does not preclude publishing open data. Data holders should always analyze how personal data could be removed from the dataset, so that the rest could still be published.</li>
<li>Data protection is only one part of the equation – it is equally important to consider the economic and social value of opening data.</li>
<li>As a data holder, look before you leap but don’t get stuck in indecision. If data publication could entail risks, analyze the risks more carefully or only publish part of the data, but there is no reason to refrain from publishing any data at all just because risks exist.</li>
<li>A paywall is not a security measure! Charging a fee for public data is only justified for covering the cost of fulfilling the data request (but no more than that).</li></p>
