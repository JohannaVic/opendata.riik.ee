  <p>Last summer the EU adopted a new open data directive that replaces the old “PSI” (public sector information) directive. This entails significant changes to European open data policy: within the next year, EU Member States need to define a list of high-value datasets that data holders will be obliged to publish as open data – with an open license, free of charge, in machine-readable formats, via APIs and, if relevant, downloadable in bulk. The directive defines the value of data mainly in terms of the potential economic and societal benefits that the data are expected to produce, but it also takes into account environmental impacts, users’ interests and opportunities for combining the data and creating innovative data-driven services.</p>
  <p><b>What and Why?</b></p>
  <p>The change is driven by the wish to improve the availability of data to foster a European data economy, reduce barriers to data reuse and ensure equality of access to data. To this end, the directive aims to make high-value data available free of charge. It also requires data from publicly funded research to be released as open data and extends open data requirements to datasets of value that may be owned by public undertakings or even private companies that provide services of general interest (e.g. those operating in the utilities or transport sectors). Furthermore, the directive is also hoped to stimulate the publication of real-time and dynamic data via APIs and improve the availability of high-quality open data that is needed for developing Artificial Intelligence solutions.</p>
  <p>By now, countries have agreed on six thematic categories of potentially high-value data. These include <b>geospatial data, environmental and Earth observation data, meteorological data, national statistics, data on companies and company ownership, and mobility</b>. What we still don’t have is a list of specific datasets in each category that will become subject to these new open data requirements. In order to get to that, the European Commission will commission an assessment of the socio-economic impacts of opening different datasets and conduct stakeholder consultations. Here, dear open data user, you also have a role to play.</p>
  <p><b>Have Your Say</b></p>
  <p>If you prefer the list of high-value datasets not to be defined behind closed doors but in collaboration with users, you have two opportunities to participate:</p>
  <ol><li>Answer a brief <a href="https://forms.gle/h8DLhrEoGZDwcDFY6">questionnaire</a> <b>by January 5</b> and let the Estonian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications know which datasets you consider to have high value. The ministry will use stakeholder input as a basis for discussions with data holders and in formulating Estonia’s proposals to the European Commission. In the meanwhile, anyone can exchange opinions with Estonian open data enthusiasts and experts and ask questions on the topic in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/openestdata">OpenEstData Facebook group</a>.</li>
  <li>Participate in the European Commission’s public consultation next year. The exact timeframe is yet to be determined but citizen consultations are likely to take place before autumn 2020 – stay tuned and prepare! You can follow the news on the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/public-sector-information-psi-directive-open-data-directive">European Commission website</a>.</li></ol> dedicated to the open data directive.
  <p><b>What Next?</b></p>
  <p>After all impact assessments, stakeholder consultations and agreements, the list of high-value datasets will be adopted as an implementing act to the directive at the end of 2020. It is worth keeping in mind, though, that no list alone will turn data into value – the latter is the hands of data holders and reusers.</p>
