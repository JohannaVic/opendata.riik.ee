We are happy to announce that in addition to the answer "Yes" we now also have guidelines and tips that may be useful for publishers of secondary datasets.</p>
<p>The new <a href=\"/juhend/#juhend-teiste-organisatsioonide-andmetel-põhinevate-andmehulkade-avaldamiseks-opendatariikee-portaalis\" title=\"Guidelines for publishing secondary datasets\">guidelines for publishing secondary datasets</a> define <b>secondary data</b> as datasets created by way of automated processing, combining or repeated loading of publicly accessible data. In a situation where the holder of the original data is not able or interested in publishing their data on the portal, these guidelines provide a basic framework for those who want to lend them a hand or add value to their data through processing or combinations with other datasets.</p>
<p>The main requirements for publishers of secondary datasets concern the obligation to make sure the data is processed in accordance with the law (this includes respecting personal data protection requirements), to allow public access to the source code of the program used for processing the data, and to provide true and detailed metadata about the dataset. This allows users to evaluate if and how they dare use the data. Note also that the guidelines are not set in stone and are ready to change based on users' feedback. Proposals for amendments and additions to the guidelines can be made <a href=\"https://github.com/okestonia/jkan/issues/403\" title=\"GitHub\">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The guidelines can be accessed <a href=\"/juhend/#juhend-teiste-organisatsioonide-andmetel-põhinevate-andmehulkade-avaldamiseks-opendatariikee-portaalis\" title=\"Guidelines for publishing secondary datasets\">HERE</a>. Now let's publish some data!</p>
