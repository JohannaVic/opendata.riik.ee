  <p>At last some happy news on environment – Statistics Estonia and the Government Office have planted a tree! The virtual <a href="https://tamm.stat.ee/">Tree of Truth (<i>Tõetamm</i>)</a>, a web application with a tongue-in-cheek name, measures Estonia’s progress towards national strategic targets and is accessible to anyone online. But how does the Tree of Truth know what is true?</p>
  <p>The answer lies in open data. <i>Tõetamm</i> provides easy-to-understand visualizations of statistical data on 135 indicators which reflect Estonia’s progress in 15 different areas, from energy to social cohesion. These indicators are derived from the goals of the Estonian sustainable development strategy Sustainable Estonia 21, reform program Estonia 2020 and the government action plan 2019–2023. Statistics Estonia is already regularly monitoring these indicators but so far one has had to dig into statistical databases and analyze complicated tables in order to get an overview of where Estonia stands. Now anyone interested can simply click on the branches and leaves of the Tree of Truth and get the full picture at a glance.</p>

  <p>Now, as a common citizen, I only need a moment to understand state of the issue that interests me. So does the policy-maker who rarely has time to delve into tables with tens of data fields. At the same time, those who want to understand the data at a more detailed level can follow the links to Statistics Estonia’s <a href="http://andmebaas.stat.ee/">public database</a>. The new version of the database is currently released in beta and provides many new opportunities for users to view and process statistical data. One of its novel features is the possibility to download the datasets as machine-readable open data in SDMX-XML and SDMX-JSON formats (SDMX is an international data standard used mostly in statistics) or access the data via an API. Also worth highlighting is the level of detail of the metadata that comes with with the datasets. It not only defines the key terms and explaina the data collection and processing methods in a human-understandable language but also contains the details of a contact person who can give more information on the data.</p>
  <p>The Tree of Truth is of course by far not the only one of its kind. Statistics Estonia has recently created several other applications that present data collected in the public interest to society and decision-makers in a user-friendly way. For example, the new <a href="https://data.stat.ee">foreign trade application</a> visualizes statistical data of Estonia’s foreign trade in goods. The application shows the main partner countries of Estonia’s exports and imports and allows tracking commodity flows through countries of origin, consignment and destination. The data can be viewed in different types of diagrams and maps according to users’ preferences.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the new <a href="https://shiny.stat.ee/tooturg/">labor policy app</a> gives a quick and simple overview of the main indicators concerning labor force and unemployment. The data can be viewed as absolute numbers or ratios, as line and bar charts, and of course downloaded as CSV files.</p>

  <p>Similar open data-driven apps and dashboards are available in other parts of the world. One of the virtual relatives of the Tree of Truth is the <a href="https://nationalperformance.gov.scot/measuring-progress/national-indicator-performance">Scottish national performance dashboard</a> and the related <a href="https://scotland.shinyapps.io/sg-equality-evidence-finder/" >Equality Evidence Finder</a>, which gives an overview of key socio-economic indicators across different societal groups in the form of visuals, graphs and explanations provided in plain language. The same indicators can be compared for groups of people based on characteristics such as age, gender, sexual orientation or religion. Users can of course also download the data to work with it at home. </p>

  <p>As a fun fact, the Scottish and Estonian approach is also similar in their use of botanical metaphors to represent national development indicators. Whereas Estonia pictures national performance goals as a tree, the Scots have visualized theirs as a <a href="https://nationalperformance.gov.scot/sites/default/files/documents/NPF_A2_Poster.pdf">flower</a> that has society’s key purpose and values at the core, surrounded by petals that denote specific outcome targets in different sectors. The national goals have also been related to the global Sustainable Development Goals, helping policy-makers and the public keep the global big picture in mind when measuring performance at the sectoral and national level.</p>
  <p>What, then, are we supposed to make out of these examples? For one, we could conclude that open data is good but data-driven applications even better. Open data is like a pack of seeds – its true value only becomes evident when the data are developed into useful services, apps and dashboards. Data dashboards are not just nice to look at but also serve as practical working tools for public officials, researchers and interest groups, in addition to allowing the government to demonstrate what has been achieved with taxpayer money in ways that citizens can actually understand. May today’s “trees of truth” become surrounded by a lush data forest!</p>
